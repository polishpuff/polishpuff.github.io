WOW, this month has been full of change and new experiences. It has been a challenge to adjust to my new schedule: work, home, dinner/coding, read, sleep, _repeat_. Before I started the program I was nervous I wouldn't love coding. I had some past experience with it and felt as though I was well-suited for it, since I'm pretty meticulous and detail-oriented, but I worried nonetheless. _What if I hated it? What if it felt like homework?_

I just recently had my Flatiron onboarding with Tracy. She was great; we reviewed where I am in the curriculum, which resources are available (how did I not know about Pocket for bookmarking?), and how to write compelling and technical blog posts. Armed with this knowledge, I'm going to work on exploring technical themes in my blog. 

I am also making an effort to get out to more events in NYC. I attended an entrepreneurship event this week where I met a Flatiron grad; we exchanged tips, contact details, and made plans to attend events together. I also went to a Rails workshop hosted through Railsbridge, an organization dedicated to exposing under-represented groups to Ruby and Rails in an inclusive space. When I first registered, I self-sorted into "beginner intermediate" level since I've only completed intro to Ruby and some HTML so far. However, day of I decided to join the advanced group with the option of switching out to intermediate if I felt overwhelmed. Turned out to be an **amazing** decision. I was able to keep up with the pace and asked questions that pre-empted topics we would cover later on. I left the workshop with a super basic jobs board website deployed on Heroku (first time I deployed something to Heroku!!).

**Railsbridge quick hits**
* html.erb (HTML + Ruby together!)
* Ruby gems are cool: [ActiveSupport](https://www.sitepoint.com/ways-activesupport-helps-ruby-developers/)
* RESTful principle

**Curriculum**
* I'm at HTML/CSS: Site Publishing - hoping to finish out all of HTML/CSS this week.

Last thing: I want to build a little calendar that tracks my progress. Maybe that's the project for the month...
