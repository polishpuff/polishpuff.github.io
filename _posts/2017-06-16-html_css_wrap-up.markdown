The past week+ I have been working through the HTML/CSS lessons. They have been more challenging than I assumed they would be. I had done some coding in HTML before joining Flatiron; it was probably the most recognizable language for me. But now I realize CSS is HARD. 

**Overarching concepts I had trouble grasping:**

- specificity. YIKES! I didn't have trouble grasping the concept but did have a bit of difficulty executing. I do think that particular lab, however was especially helpful in re-affirming classes. 
- floats, ~~not as hard as I had been fooled into believing by the internet. But then again, maybe they are super tricky and I just don't realize.~~ HA just kidding! I started the next lab and realized THEY ARE SO HARD. It's as though the universe did this on purpose.

The codealongs were great but as soon as I had to write my own CSS I was totally lost. 

**Zetsy/ZHW Shoes Labs**
1. I tried to format "header" to hold font-family and color but it wouldn't work. That's when I realized I have to format h1, h2, h3 individually. 

2. Then I forgot how to pad and margin, so I went back to the Exceptional Realty code to refresh borders, padding, and margin. 

**Media queries**

This was perhaps my favorite part of CSS. I'm on the lookout for places where media queries might be used on every website I visit now.

I think by the time I got to Bootstrap I felt much more comfortable with CSS. All of the code fell into place for me.

I'd love to be able to practice a little bit proactively. I've been working in exercism.io on some Ruby practice exercises and *really* wish they offered CSS as well. I've been working on a friend's personal website pro-bono so maybe diving back into that would be the best way to keep my skills sharp.
