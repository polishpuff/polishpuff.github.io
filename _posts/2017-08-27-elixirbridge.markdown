Two weekends ago I had an incredible opportunity to attend an all-day workshop at Casper focused on Elixir and Phoenix. The workshop was hosted by <a href="https://www.bridgetroll.org/">Bridge Troll</a>, an organization devoted to making programming accessible to more people including those who are under-represented in technology. 

I didn't know anything about Elixir before the workshop; first step was understanding that Elixir was the language and Phoenix was the framework. As a greener developer, it can be a challenege to wade through all the various languages and frameworks (<i>Django? React? Sinatra?</i>) and all of these seem to be changing so quickly, so it's refreshing to have a mini tutorial like this. 

It's also a challenge to realize everything I do not know. For example:

<ul><li>What is big O notation?</li> <li>What is functional vs. non-functional programming?</li> <li>Immutability?</li> <li>Dynamically compiled?</li><li>Arity?</li></ul>

Simultaneously, this is what is so exciting about learning to code. I had the chance to attend a workshop, absorb all of these brand new terms, and then go home and learn about them on my own. Workshops like these also give me a chance to reflect on how much I have already learned. Throughout the workshop, although there were times I was lost, I found myself thinking 'ah, string interpolation, I know what that is' or 'that seems just like a hash in Ruby'. 

What I was able to learn about Elixir during the workshop was pretty near. It is based on Erlang, which was a language developed for telephony switches in the 1980's. While Elixir is a relatively new language it has this time-tested base of Erlang that it rests on.

These days What's App uses it on their backend. It seems like a great language for someone who has Ruby experience, even though there are some major differences between them; this <a href"https://blog.carbonfive.com/2016/04/19/elixir-and-phoenix-the-future-of-web-apis-and-apps/">article</a> is a good resource for more information about Elixir. 

There was one downside to the workshop, which was that the instructor wasn't a fan of test-driven development. Instead of giving us the space to code, run and test, make mistakes and course-correct, he told us exactly what to code and waited until the very end to run the code. I had a hard time adjusting to this style of coding. It made me realize just how accustomed I have become to TDD. I'm hoping that's a positive and a quality that makes me a stronger developer.
