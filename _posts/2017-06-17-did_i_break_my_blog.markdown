Is a question I'm wondering. 

Basically, I decided I wanted to change the look of the blog. No harm there, right?

I attended a Flatiron event and one of the engineers walked me through which files I should and shouldn't touch in my GitHub repo. Then I forgot which ones they were! 

The other night I finished the CSS section of the curriculum so I thought, *"well now is the time to jump in and see what I retained."* 

I did some research on Jekyll and decided to start with changing the header pics and the font color. NO HARM THERE RIGHT?

Oops...
