2016 was a year I learned how to internalize lessons. I've always been good at *learning* but only recently did I realize I am not good at *using what I learned in future lessons*. Learning is the easy part. 

I decided that 2016 would be the year I hear criticism, internalize it, and spit it back out as an improvement, a strength. I figured once I was able to do that, I could make use of anything negative and use it to fuel a positive change. I practiced all year: at home, at work, with friends. I *think* I emerged stronger; I **hope** I'm not wrong.

Just recently I thought perhaps I could take it one step further in 2017. Why wait around for feedback to be given or a lesson to present itself? I can challenge my own boundaries. 

* Lesson 1: Learn to Risk

I decided to pursue programming mostly because it's fun, but partially because it's a risk. It's risky to put myself in situations where I'm uncomfortable and don't know the answers. 

So far, I'm only about 40% through Ruby but already I have found myself stressed, frustrated, second-guessing my decision to do this. But, as I knew before-hand, the thrill of success is absolutely worth it.
